# 1) geom_label or geom_text would allow you to add text to a plot
# 2) You would use scale_*_date for this.

# Part C

#Read in data

#Section 10.1

# 1) I was decently comfortable with this lesson, since I have some ggplot2 experience. I did struggle
#with a few parts.

# 2) I am having trouble with scale_y_continuous and scale_x_continuous. I didn't understand how to
#change the x-axis breaks to go up by 0.1, so I tried to code for a break sequence. I've also used limits
#before and was a little rusty there, because I don't feel like they did what I want.

# 3) This lesson was pretty thorough, which I liked. Maybe learning more about positions and aesthetics!
